# About Me

Howdy!

I am Leanne Blind, a current Department of Atmospheric Sciences master's student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. You can learn more about my current research 
and view my CV [here]()https://atmos.illinois.edu/directory/profile/leanneb2. My meteorological interests include mesoscale meteorology and instrumentation. In my spare
time, I enjoy being in nature, going to wineries, singing, and exercising. I am fairly new to GitHub, but am learning more everyday. Please reach out if you have any 
questions or would like to collaborate!
